# Vimeo Take Home Assessment for Summer Internship Application

Media application that uses **React.js** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend.

## Running the application 

Ensure you have **Node** and **NPM** installed.

### When you have a proper clone
In the root folder of the project (VimeoTakeHome) type `npm run setup` to run the setup script that installs the node modules in both folders

Once both installs have successfully finished, you must get both the frontend and backend running.
To get both the backend and frontend running, open two terminals with one being in the frontend directory and the other in the backend directory.
Type
```
npm start
```
To start them respectively.
